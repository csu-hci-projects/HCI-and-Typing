    "This is a random paragraph that you will type because you like typing but it will be easy because there are no commas or periods and really just consists of a run on sentence that is continuing to be a run on sentence with more run on words and sentences and really keeps on going until you run out of time and start to get bored because you are typing so much and you want to stop typing sometime soon but it keeps on going to test your skills",
    "This paragraph is a little more challenging. It will consist of some harder words that can sometimes trip people up. It will also consist of some basic punctuation that most typists use on a day to day basis. Some words that people have a hard time typing, are words like receive, believe, or prestigious. Those aren't that hard I guess but it doesn't matter what I put in here you will type it as fast as possible anyways. So keep on typing and don't worry.",
    "I am going to keep on adding these random paragraphs because I can't find any random text generator api that actually gives me text that I want. I just wanted to Google for something like random text api and nothing was really coming up that could generate text that was this long and made some sense. I tried to use a random Wikipedia page generator but that didn't really work becuase it had citations, numbers, and weird stuff like that.",
    "Okay one more paragraph for the day that I will type up here so that you can type this and see how many words per minute you can get with as little errors as humanely possible. There was once a frog who was long and blue. He decided that he wanted to be a tree so he turned into one and then became a donkey who flew over the mountains and found far away places that smelled like hummus and penguins. These typing tests are so weird right?"
